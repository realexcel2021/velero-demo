# Set up Velero on EKS Cluster

This repository demonstrates how to provision an EKS cluster and set up velero for cluster back ups and disaster recovery. To use this repository, you'll need the following installed and set up

- AWS CLI and Credentials Set
- Terraform Installed
- Ensure your AWS credential can create other Users

kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml
```

Create a sample back up using velero

```
velero backup create demo
```

Describe the back up

```
